# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is a part of the Kaggle competition on Titanic survival prediction. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is a well-known tragedy, and this competition aims to build a predictive model to determine the factors that influenced the survival of passengers based on various attributes such as name, age, gender, class, etc.

# Challenge Description
The sinking of the Titanic resulted in the loss of many lives due to a shortage of lifeboats. The objective of this challenge is to analyze the passenger data and identify patterns that indicate which groups of people were more likely to survive the disaster.

# Steps Involved
# 1. Importing the Libraries
The project starts by importing the necessary libraries required for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

# 2. Importing the Dataset
The dataset containing the passenger information is imported for analysis and model development. This dataset includes attributes such as name, age, gender,class, and more.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This step involves data visualization, statistical summaries, and exploring relationships between different variables. The goal is to understand the distribution of data and identify any patterns or correlations.

# 4. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step that involves handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary data transformations. This ensures that the data is suitable for model training and evaluation.

# 5. Train-Test Split
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the predictive model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

# 6. Model Training and Evaluation
Different machine learning algorithms are applied to the training data to build predictive models. The models are trained using various techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or other suitable algorithms. Model performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

# 7. Test Submission
The final step involves generating predictions on the test set and submitting the results to the Kaggle competition. The predictions are based on the trained model's ability to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers in the test dataset.

# Dependencies
The project relies on the following libraries:
1.NumPy 
2.Pandas
3.Matplotlib
4.Seaborn
5.Scikit-learn
Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the project.
